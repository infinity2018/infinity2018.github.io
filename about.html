                <h1><u>DEPARTMENT  OF MATHEMATICS</u></h1>
                <p>The Department of Mathematics came into being in 1960. Fifty  years down the line, it has had much to feel happy about. It has had a faculty  committed to the cause of excellence and also students—scores of them—who have  brought glory to it by their brilliant academic performance. During the period  1985-2010 alone, several 1st classes apart, 7 students of the Dept. stood 1st  class 1st in University exams, one of them securing the First position among  all the science graduates of the University (1997). This speaks volumes.<br>
          The Department started with eight to ten boys on its rolls.  These boys, already into their second year at Dinabandhu Andrews College  (Garia), decided to forgo a precious year of their career and join the  fledgling Department of Mathematics here. The first faculty comprised four  teachers Sri Baidyanath Basu, Sri Sudarsan Das, Sri Rasik Chandra Chakraborty  and Sri Gobindadev Bhattacharya. Sri Gobindadev Bhattacharya was the first Head  of the Dept. The Dept. was soon joined by Dr. Yudisthir De, Dr. Nanipada  Bhanja, and a little later by Sri Makhanlal Nag who succeeded Sri G.  Bhattacharya as HOD and served as Vice-Principal of the College till his  retirement in 1979. The Dept. moved from strength to strength as years rolled  by. From the very beginning the Dept. had the privilege of having some  well-known teachers agree to teach here part-time, thanks largely to the  initiative taken by Dr. Bikas Chandra Sanyal, the then Prof-in-charge of our  College, whose great mentor was Swami Lokeswaranandaji himself. The Dept. will  and does gratefully remember Sri Ramkrishna Ghosh (St. Xavier's College), Sri  Hemendra Kanta Ganguli (formerly of Scottish Church College) and Sri Murari  Mohan Roy Choudhury (formerly of Presidency College and CU) and Sri Nalini  Ranjan Roy for their services to and affection for the Dept. They the boost the  Dept. needed for forging ahead in vigour.</p>
                <p>No annals of the growth and development of the Dept. can do  without a loving and respectful remembrance of Sri Sudarsan Das who joined the  Dept. in 1961 and was its Head till his retirement in 1995. He was an  outstanding teacher the memory of whose unique style of exposition left an  indelible mark on the minds of his students. His students loved him and held  him in the highest esteem. Affable, soft-spoken, affectionate, he served the  Dept. with exemplary dedication. He was a good actor and directed many plays  put on the boards during college functions. His superannuation in 1995 marked  the end of an era in the history of the Dept.</p>
                <p>The present faculty of five members, headed by Dr. Nurul  Islam, has been putting in their best efforts to keep up the tradition of  excellence set up by their predecessors. The students of the Dept., apart from  their pursuit of academic excellence, have always shown a keen interest in the  different co-curricular activities of the college.</p>
                <p>The Dept. faculty is actively engaged in UGC-DST-sponsored  research projects and publication of books and study materials. Dr. Nurul Islam  HOD has been guiding doctoral work for some time now. Dr. Parthasarathi  Mukhopadhyay has a lot of solid achievements to his credit. He visited Bangkok,  Hongkong, Berlin, Madrid and Budapest (Hungary) on invitation to present  papers. Dr. Bijoy Kumar Bera who headed the Dept. from 1998 to 2010 played a  significant role in sustaining the upward mobility of the Dept. and enhancing  its reputation. Post retirement, he has been appointed Deputy Controller of  Examinations of our College.</p>
                <p>Several ex-pupils of the Dept. are occupying top faculty  positions in institutions of higher education in our country. Mention must be  made in this connection of Dr. Imran Habib Biswas (TIFR), Dr. Ujjal Koley  (TIFR), Dr. Sanjoy Pusti (IIT Kanpur), Dr. Suman Kundu (Vanderbilt University,  Nashville), Dr. Ashish Mondal (IIT Kanpur), Sri Pravash Roy (CU Retd.), Sri  Saktipada Ghorai (IIT, Kanpur), Sri Ranjit Dhar (Registrar, Vidyasagar  University), Sri Sunil Maity (Burdwan University), Sri Anjan Bhuniya (Visva  Bharati) and Sri Prakash Chandra Mali (JU).</p>
                <p>The Dept. does not rest on its laurels. It continues its  efforts at further excellence and looks forward to a brighter future.</p>

          <p><span dir="LTR">Though  Statistics was taught as a pass subject as early as 1960, the Dept. of  Statistics emerged as an Honours Department a couple of years later. Ever  since, it has had many achievements to its credit, particularly in respect of  academic performance by its students in University exams.</span><br><br><br>
            <span dir="LTR">We,  the students of</span><span dir="LTR"> department of mathematics and statistics,has been  organising our fest named &lsquo;INFINITY&rsquo; since 4 years. Our aim is to grow interest  in mathematics, statistics and logical thinking. In this year, 2018, we add a  new event &lsquo;Master Mind&rsquo;, logical event where everyone studying in B.Sc. can  participate in the event. Here is an event &lsquo;Colloquium&rsquo; where selected  participants can represent themselves on stage and face some questions by the  audience and professors. All the participants will get participation  certificate and respective winners will get trophy for each position 1st  and 2nd for &lsquo;Colloquium&rsquo; &amp; &lsquo;Quiz&rsquo; and 1st , 2nd  , 3rd for &lsquo;Master Mind&rsquo;.</span><span dir="LTR"> </span>
